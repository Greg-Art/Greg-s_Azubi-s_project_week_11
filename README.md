# Greg-s_Azubi-s_project_week_11
This is my first machine learning project I did whiles enrolled in the Azubi Data Analytics Program 
This aim of this project was the predict the prices of homes in California using various machine learning linear regression models. 

In our project, my team members used LinearRegressor; however, I used the KNeighborRegressor and a RobustScaler to improve the performance of the model.
